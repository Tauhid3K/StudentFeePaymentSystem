<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>

<h4>1. How do I submit my payment?</h4>
<p>
    After sending your semester fee through bKash, Nagad, or DBBL,
    log in to your student dashboard and enter the Transaction ID.
    Make sure the Transaction ID is correct and matches the payment method you used.
</p>

<h4>2. How can I download my payment receipt?</h4>
<p>
    Once your payment is approved by the admin, you will find a “Receipt” button
    under your Payment Status page. Clicking it will generate your official receipt.
</p>

<h4>3. Why is my payment still pending?</h4>
<p>
    Payments may remain pending if the admin has not yet verified your Transaction ID.
    Verification usually takes some time depending on the workload.
    If it stays pending for too long, your Transaction ID might be incorrect
    or unclear—please recheck or contact support.
</p>

<h4>4. What should I do if my payment is rejected?</h4>
<p>
    If your payment is rejected, you will see the reason in your dashboard.
    In most cases, the transaction ID may be invalid or not found.
    Simply submit a new valid Transaction ID using the resubmission form.
