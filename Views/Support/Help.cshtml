<p>
    Welcome to the Help Center of the Student Fee Payment System.
    Here you will find information, guidelines, and step-by-step instructions
    on how to use the system effectively. Our goal is to ensure that every
    student can easily submit their semester fees, track payment status,
    and download receipts without any confusion.
</p>

<p>
    If you are new, start by registering an account using your valid student details.
    Once logged in, go to your dashboard to view your pending payments.
    You can submit your Transaction ID after sending the fee through bKash, Nagad,
    or DBBL. The admin team will verify your payment and update the status accordingly.

<p>
    For any issues, such as payment rejection, login problems, or incorrect details,
    please check the FAQs or contact the support team through the Contact Info page.
